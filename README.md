# Logistic Regression Model

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Logistic Regression** model for binary classification tasks. Logistic Regression is a widely used machine learning algorithm to predict categorical outcomes based on input features.

## Overview

- **Binary Classification**: Predicts binary outcomes (e.g., 0 or 1).
- **Modeling**: Trains the Logistic Regression model on labeled data.
- **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`.
